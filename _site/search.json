One called team-results.csv and another called public-picks.csv. Team-results contains ‘TEAMID’ as the unique identifier or primary key as well as several attributes that quantify the team’s performance in the tournament in each round. Team-results also quantifies the team’s performance vs Komputer Expectations and Seed Expectations.\nPublic-picks.csv contains public prediction data for teams in the tournament. Public-picks contains ‘TEAMNO’ as the unique identifier or primary key. Public-picks contains several attributes quantifying the percent of people who picked that team to win each round of the tournament.\nI chose this dataset for several reasons. I love sports, and wanted to use a dataset that is relevant to my personal interests in order to make this project more interesting. Any sports fan knows that “did you fill out your bracket?” dominates water cooler conversations in late February and early March. There are no recorded instances of someone making a perfect bracket prediction, and the odds of that happening are infinitesimal. When large numbers of crowds are attempting to predict unpredictable outcomes (gambling, the stock market) some interesting hivemind dynamics can come into play. One example, almost every year, a 12-seed team upsets a 5-seed team. One of the common questions asked when people fill out brackets is “who is your 12-5?” meaning: “of the 4 games in the first round in which a 12 seed plays a 5 seed, which 12 seed do you think will get the victory?” A quick google search shows that in the past 18 NCAA Tournaments, there have been 30 instances of a 12-5 upset. This equates to a 41.6% win percentage for a much lower seeded team. This seems unlikely, but happens with some regularity (almost half the time). I am also interested in discovering which teams, if any, consistently outperform or underperform fan expectations.\nMake sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information."

Ensure correct formatting. Dataframes may have to be merged on a common value (primary keys). Then for each team in each round I will compare the public pick percentages with the actual outcomes and determine metrics for prediction accuracy. My hypothesis is that as the rounds advance toward Final 4 and championship, public pick accuracy will decrease. I will then determine which visualizations will be most effective in communicating my findings\nQ2 plan: Load and clean data from team-results.csv. Use PASE and PASERANK columns to determine how teams performed relative to seed expectations. Use data from public-picks.csv to determine how the team performed relative to crowd expectations. Identify which teams (if any) consistently over or underperform relative to seeding and crowd expectations. Then I will determine the appropriate ways to visualize this information."
