One called team-results.csv and another called public-picks.csv. Team-results contains ‘TEAMID’ as the unique identifier or primary key as well as several attributes that quantify the team’s performance in the tournament in each round. Team-results also quantifies the team’s performance vs Komputer Expectations and Seed Expectations.\nPublic-picks.csv contains public prediction data for teams in the tournament. Public-picks contains ‘TEAMNO’ as the unique identifier or primary key. Public-picks contains several attributes quantifying the percent of people who picked that team to win each round of the tournament.\nI chose this dataset for several reasons. I love sports, and wanted to use a dataset that is relevant to my personal interests in order to make this project more interesting. Any sports fan knows that “did you fill out your bracket?” dominates water cooler conversations in late February and early March. There are no recorded instances of someone making a perfect bracket prediction, and the odds of that happening are infinitesimal. When large numbers of crowds are attempting to predict unpredictable outcomes (gambling, the stock market) some interesting hivemind dynamics can come into play. One example, almost every year, a 12-seed team upsets a 5-seed team. One of the common questions asked when people fill out brackets is “who is your 12-5?” meaning: “of the 4 games in the first round in which a 12 seed plays a 5 seed, which 12 seed do you think will get the victory?” A quick google search shows that in the past 18 NCAA Tournaments, there have been 30 instances of a 12-5 upset. This equates to a 41.6% win percentage for a much lower seeded team. This seems unlikely, but happens with some regularity (almost half the time). I am also interested in discovering which teams, if any, consistently outperform or underperform fan expectations."

    "text": "Explanation of terms (for non sports fans)\nEvery year at the end of the Men’s College Basketball season, the best 64 teams are selected by a committee to participate in a tournament to determine the champion of the season. The tournament is conducted in a single elimination format, meaning a team is eliminated from contention as soon as they lose a game. The teams are assigned “seeds” between 1 and 16. The seeding is kind of like a rank. The 4 teams with a 1 seed are considered the favorites to win the tournament, while the 4 teams with a 16 seed are the underdogs. A bracket looks something like this.\n\nIn the opening round, the 16 seeds play against 1 seeds, 15 seeds play against 2 seeds, and so on. This is advantageous to the higher seed teams because they begin the tournament playing against teams ranked significantly lower than them. There has only been 1 instance of a 16 seed beating a 1 seed in the history of the tournament. As discussed before, there have been many instances of 12 seeds defeating 5 seeds, which seems counter-intuitive because of how the seeds are assigned (upsets of that nature should be uncommon).\nAfter seeds are assigned and the teams all “know their place” in the tournament, fans (and oftentimes even non sports fans) will make predictions as to how the tournament could play out. There are no recorded instances of someone making a perfectly correct bracket prediction. There are 63 games in the tournament, which calculates to 2^63 possible outcomes. The odds of a random guesser filling out a perfect bracket are 1 in 9.2 quintillion. The tournament only lasts a few days and is often filled with upsets, unlikely contenders lasting much longer than they should (often referred to as Cinderella Stories), and basketball on the television all day for several days for sports fans. This short lived excitement has earned the tournament the nickname “March Madness”."

    "text": "Introduction\nThis study makes use of 2 data sources. First is NCAA Men’s March Madness, sourced from Nishaan Amin’s Kaggle dataset. This dataset includes historical data for the Men’s College Basketball tournament from 2008 - 2004. The 2 files are team-results.csv and public-picks.csv. Team-results contains statistics from previous tournaments mapped to each team. Stats include wins, losses, Performance Against Seed Expectations, Performance Against Komputer Expectations, amount of times teams made it to each round, and winning percentage. Public-picks contains data about public predictions for the outcome of the 2024 NCAA Tournament. I wound up merging these datasets into one dataframe for analysis.\nThe first goal of this project is to explore trends and see what factors influence fan predictions. Every year before the tournament, fans fill out brackets which serve as a prediction of what they think the outcome of each game in the tournament will be. Teams are assigned seeds 1-16. Your seed is based on regular season performance. A 1 seed is favored to win, while a 16 seed barely made the tournament and is considered an underdog. In the first round, 1 seeds play 16 seeds, 2 seeds play 15 seeds, 3 plays 14 and so on. This brings me to the second goal of the study, which is to identify which teams have historically outperformed or underperformed expectations and identify upset trends from past tournaments."

To accomplish this task we use parts of the dataset that include Win percentage, total wins, total losses, PASE, PAKE, number of Final 4 appearances, and calculated championship likelihood. This analysis highlights the contrast between simple, visible metrics and more advanced and nuanced metrics. Understanding these influences can help analysts and fans predict trends, identify biases, and understand the factors that contribute to the excitement and unpredictability of the March Madness tournament."

This heatmap visually represents the correlation coefficients between historical performance metrics and public pick percentages for each round of the 2024 tournament. These metrics include Win%, total wins, total losses, PASE, PAKE, Final 4 appearance likelihood (calculated) and championship likelihood (calculated). Each cell in the heatmap displays the correlation coefficient, which indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between that metric and the public’s prediction for the team to win a game in that round. The correlation heatmap is ideal because it provides a comprehensive view of the statistical relationships among multiple variables simultaneously. It allows us to quickly visualize which metrics have the strongest influence on public perception."

    "text": "Question 1 Discussion\nThe correlation heatmap reveals several trends in the data. We see that Win % and Final 4 percent have very strong correlations in the early rounds (R64 - S16). That correlation wanes in strength toward the later rounds, however. This could indicate that fans are looking at obvious, visible statistics when selecting teams in the early rounds. We can also see that PASE and PAKE have very low correlations in the early rounds, but the correlation grows stronger toward the late rounds (E8-FINALS). While PASE and PAKE can be great indicators of team performance, they aren’t used by fans to select teams in early round games. The increase for PASE and PAKE toward later rounds could be indicative that fans are using them for later rounds, but the correlation still isn’t extremely strong. These findings highlight that public predictions are largely influenced by simpler metrics, particularly in early rounds. Advanced metrics become more significant as the tournament progresses."

Is there any truth to the 12-5 upset narrative?\nI wanted to perform analysis to find out which teams consistently perform better, and worse, than the seeders project them to. The team-results.csv file contains data for a statistic called PASE (Performance Against Seed Expectations). PASE measures the difference between how a team is projected to perform and how they actually perform in the tournament. A high PASE value means that a team consistently surpasses expectations and vice versa. Along the same line, I wanted to investigate the statistics behind the narrative of 12-5 upsets. A common piece of advice or “fan wisdom” in March Madness is that in the first round, there will be at least one upset in which a 12 seed team defeats a 5 seed team. For the 12-5 question, I used github user christoukmaji’s MarchMadnessDatasets repo because it contained more specific information regarding team performance in individual games."

    "text": "Question 2 Approach\nThis question is divided into 2 “sub-questions” and necessitated the creation of 2 separate visuals. For the PASE analysis I used a diverging bar chart. I knew that some values would be positive, and some negative. I wanted to show the top 5 overachievers and top 5 underachievers. I decided that a color coded diverging bar chart would be the perfect way to display this information. This would be a very easily digestible way to communicate to the audience which teams constantly overperform, and which ones consistently disappoint.\nTo investigate any correlation between seeding and upset likelihood, I used a standard bar chart. It shows the winning percentage of teams by seed 9-16. In the tournament, 9 seeds face 8 seeds in the first round (not a huge upset, fairly minor). To the far right side of the bar chart, 16 seeds face 1 seeds in the first round. A 16 seed defeating a 1 seed is a massive upset, and has only happened twice in tournament history (2018 and 2023). We can see in the graph that 9 seeds are around 40% win percentage, 11 seeds are near 50% win percentage, 12 seeds are near 40%, followed by a steep drop off for 13 seeds and below. This shows that there is some truth to the narrative of 12-5 upsets, and that perhaps 11-6 upsets aren’t being talked about enough."

    "text": "Question 2 Discussion\nThis analysis reveals some notable trends in March Madness performance. In the PASE bar chart, we see which teams perform to expectation, and which don’t. Connecticut has the highest PASE ranking, and Texas has the lowest. This divergence underscores the unpredictability of March Madness tournaments and how some teams seem to consistently deliver, while others don’t. A notable fact from this analysis, every team in the Top 5 PASE has won at least 1 National Championship since the year 2000, some (UConn, UNC) have won multiple championships in that timeframe. None of the bottom 5 has won a National Championship since 2000.\nThe seeding bar chart reveals some interesting trends as well. We would expect to see 9 seeds with the highest win %, and that win % would decrease as the seed increases. That trend does hold in most cases, with 11 seeds and 12 seeds being the outliers. This lends some truth to the narrative of the 12-5 upset and begs the question, why isn’t the 11-6 upset discussed more often? The answer lies in the date range of our data. If you analyze seasons back to 1985, 12-5 upsets do become more common. However, most casual fans have short term memory, and aren’t considering tournaments that occurred when 8 track tapes were still around."

Perhaps fans are choosing them as the 12-5 upset and their PASE rank decreases because they can’t pull it off.\nPurdue - also a bottom 5 team in PASE rank. Purdue had an excellent 2024 regular season, and were predicted to win the championship by approximately 10% of fans. Perhaps this one outlier effected the correlation between PASE and fans predicting that team to win in the finals.\nTo conclude, this study answered some questions, and raised even more!"

You can use the display style with double dollar signs:\n$$\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$\n\\[\n\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\n\\]\nLimitations:\n\nThe source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting $$ must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending $$ must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;\nThere should not be spaces after the opening $ or before the closing $."

You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.\nBut some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs."
