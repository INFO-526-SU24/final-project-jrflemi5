For the first analysis, public pick percentages for each round will be compared with actual outcomes to calculate prediction accuracy, with a hypothesis that accuracy decreases in later rounds. For the second analysis, team performance will be assessed relative to seed expectations using PASE and PASERANK metrics and public picks data to highlight teams that consistently exceed or fall short of expectations. The findings will be visualized to effectively communicate insights into public prediction accuracy and team performance trends\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\npackage 'ggimage' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\Reagan\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpO8lPpt\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\npackage 'jpeg' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\Reagan\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpO8lPpt\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\npackage 'magick' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\Reagan\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpO8lPpt\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\npackage 'png' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\Reagan\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpO8lPpt\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
